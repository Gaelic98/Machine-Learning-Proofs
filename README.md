# Machine-Learning-Proofs
This repository is a pet project of mine. Its purpose is to attempt to archive important proofs for concepts used in machine learning.
While this is obviosly never going to be completyly possible I wished to attempt to archive as many ML proofs as possible in order to avoid having to search through archgives of research material to findd the one proof I needed. 

Controbutions and Corrections are very welcome.
